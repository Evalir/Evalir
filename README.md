Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm somewhat of a quirky Software Engineer who likes to build things and chat about music. I currently work as a Software Engineer at Aragon One, in which I work with design and product to launch experiments and drive product initiatives to find PMF in the Blockchain (Ethereum) space. I also do Frontend Engineering (and all things javascript, for that matter), to improve and maintain our already existing products. Before that I was working at Digital Human, a digital transformation company.

On my spare time, I like to play bass and guitar, mess with synths, [write](https://enriqueortiz.dev/blog) and advocate about a decentralized, free world wide web. Don't be hesitant to shoot me a messageâ€”Especially if they're bad jokes. Send me your best!
